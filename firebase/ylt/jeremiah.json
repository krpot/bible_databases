sword, go on, stand not, Remember ye from afar Jehovah, And let Jerusalem come up on your heart.","051":"We have been ashamed, for we heard reproach, Covered hath shame our faces, For come in have strangers, against the sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah.","052":"Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah, And I have seen after its graven images, And in all its land groan doth the wounded.","053":"Because Babylon goeth up to the heavens, And because it fenceth the high place of its strength, From Me come into it do spoilers, An affirmation of Jehovah.","054":"A voice of a cry `is\u0027 from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldean.","055":"For Jehovah is spoiling Babylon, And hath destroyed out of it a great voice, And sounded have its billows as many waters, Given forth a noise hath their voice.","056":"For come in against it -- against Babylon -- hath a spoiler, And captured have been its mighty ones, Broken have been their bows, For the God of recompences -- Jehovah -- doth certainly repay.","057":"And I have caused its princes to drink, And its wise men, its governors, And its prefects, and its mighty ones, And they have slept a sleep age-during, And they awake not -- an affirmation of the king, Jehovah of Hosts `is\u0027 His name.","058":"Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, the wall of Babylon -- The broad one -- is utterly made bare, And her high gates with fire are burnt, And peoples labour in vain, And nations in fire, and have been weary!","059":"The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign -- and Seraiah `is\u0027 a quiet prince;","060":"and Jeremiah writeth all the evil that cometh unto Babylon on one book -- all these words that are written concerning Babylon.","061":"And Jeremiah saith unto Seraiah, `When thou dost enter Babylon, then thou hast seen, and hast read all these words,","062":"and hast said: Jehovah, Thou, Thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that there is none dwelling in it, from man even unto cattle, for it is a desolation age-during.","063":"And it hath come to pass, when thou dost finish reading this book, thou dost bind to it a stone, and hast cast it into the midst of Phrat,","064":"and said, Thus sink doth Babylon, and it doth not arise, because of the evil that I am bringing in against it, and they have been weary.\u0027 Hitherto `are\u0027 words of Jeremiah."},"052":{"001":"A son of twenty and one years `is\u0027 Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is\u0027 Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.","002":"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim hath done,","003":"for, because of the anger of Jehovah, it hath been in Jerusalem and Judah till He hath cast them from before His face, and Zedekiah doth rebel against the king of Babylon.","004":"And it cometh to pass, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, come hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon -- he and all his force -- against Jerusalem, and they encamp against it, and build against it a fortification round about;","005":"and the city cometh into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.","006":"In the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, when the famine is severe in the city, and there hath been no bread for the people of the land,","007":"then is the city broken up, and all the men of war flee, and go forth from the city by night, the way of the gate between the two walls, that `is\u0027 by the king\u0027s garden -- and the Chaldeans `are\u0027 by the city round about -- and they go the way of the plain.","008":"And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after the king, and overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his forces have been scattered from him,","009":"and they capture the king, and bring him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he speaketh with him -- judgments.","010":"And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also all the princes of Judah hath he slaughtered in Riblah;","011":"and the eyes of Zedekiah he hath blinded, and he bindeth him in brazen fetters, and the king of Babylon bringeth him to Babylon, and putteth him in the house of inspection unto the day of his death.","012":"And in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month -- it `is\u0027 the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon -- come hath Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners; he hath stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem,","013":"and he burneth the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house he hath burned with fire,","014":"and all the walls of Jerusalem round about broken down have all the forces of the Chaldeans that `are\u0027 with the chief of the executioners.","015":"And of the poor of the people, and the remnant of the people who are left in the city, and those who are falling away, who have fallen unto the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the multitude, hath Nebuzar-Adan chief of the executioners, removed;","016":"and of the poor of the land hath Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.","017":"And the pillars of brass that `are\u0027 to the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the brasen sea that `is\u0027 in the house of Jehovah, have the Chaldeans broken, and they bear away all the brass of them to Babylon;","018":"and the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they minister, they have taken away;","019":"and the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups, the gold of that which `is\u0027 gold, and the silver of that which `is\u0027 silver, hath the chief of the executioners taken.","020":"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen that `are\u0027 beneath the bases, that king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah, there was no weighing of the brass of all these vessels.","021":"As to the pillars, eighteen cubits `is\u0027 the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits doth compass it, and its thickness `is\u0027 four fingers hollow.","022":"And the chapiter upon it `is\u0027 of brass, and the height of the one chapiter `is\u0027 five cubits, and net-work and pomegranates `are\u0027 on the chapiter round about, the whole `is\u0027 of brass; and like these have the second pillar, and pomegranates.","023":"And the pomegranates are ninety and six on a side, all the pomegranates `are\u0027 a hundred on the net-work round about.","024":"And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold,","025":"and out of the city he hath taken a certain eunuch, who hath been inspector over the men of war, and seven men of those seeing the king\u0027s face, who have been found in the city, and the head scribe of the host, who mustereth the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land, who are found in the midst of the city;","026":"and Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, taketh them, and bringeth them unto the king of Babylon to Riblah,","027":"and the king of Babylon smiteth them, and putteth them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he removeth Judah from off its own ground.","028":"This `is\u0027 the people whom Nebuchadrezzar hath removed: in the seventh year, of Jews, three thousand and twenty and three;","029":"in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar -- from Jerusalem, souls, eight hundred thirty and two;","030":"in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, hath Nebuzar-Adan chief of the guard removed of Jewish souls, seven hundred forty and five; all the souls `are\u0027 four thousand and six hundred.","031":"And it cometh to pass, in the thirty and seventh year of the removal of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and fifth of the month, hath Evil-Merodach king of Babylon lifted up, in the year of his reign, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and bringeth him out from the house of restraint,","032":"and speaketh with him good things, and setteth his throne above the throne of the kings who `are\u0027 with him in Babylon,","033":"and he hath changed his prison garments, and he hath eaten bread before him continually, all the days of his life.","034":"And his allowance -- a continual allowance -- hath been given to him by the king of Babylon, the matter of a day in its day, till the day of his death -- all days of his life."}}
