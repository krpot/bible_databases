heavens, and the things upon the earth -- in him;","011":"in whom also we did obtain an inheritance, being foreordained according to the purpose of Him who the all things is working according to the counsel of His will,","012":"for our being to the praise of His glory, `even\u0027 those who did first hope in the Christ,","013":"in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth -- the good news of your salvation -- in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,","014":"which is an earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.","015":"Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love to all the saints,","016":"do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,","017":"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition of him,","018":"the eyes of your

gift,","009":"not of works, that no one may boast;","010":"for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may walk.","011":"Wherefore, remember, that ye `were\u0027 once the nations in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,","012":"that ye were at that time apart from Christ, having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world;","013":"and now, in Christ

man,","017":"that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,","018":"that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what `is\u0027 the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,","019":"to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled -- to all the fulness of God;","020":"and to Him who
