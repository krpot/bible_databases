{"001":{"001":"In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,","002":"in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;","003":"who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,","004":"having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.","005":"For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?\u0027 and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?\u0027","006":"and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;\u0027","007":"and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;\u0027","008":"and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, `is\u0027 to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness `is\u0027 the scepter of thy reign;","009":"thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners;\u0027","010":"and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;","011":"these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,","012":"and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.\u0027","013":"And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?\u0027","014":"are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"},"002":{"001":"Because of this it behoveth `us\u0027 more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,","002":"for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,","003":"how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,","004":"God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.","005":"For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,","006":"and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, `What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?","007":"Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over the works of Thy hands,","008":"all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,\u0027 for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,","009":"and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.","010":"For it was becoming to Him, because of whom `are\u0027 the all things, and through whom `are\u0027 the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,","011":"for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified `are\u0027 all of one, for which cause he is not

Him;\u0027","013":"and again, `Behold I and the children that God did give to me.\u0027","014":"Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --","015":"and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,","016":"for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold,","017":"wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the

stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,","003":"for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,","004":"for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build `is\u0027 God,","005":"and Moses indeed `was\u0027 stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a

wilderness,","009":"in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;","010":"wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in

said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;\u0027 and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,","004":"for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh `day\u0027 thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;\u0027","005":"and in this `place\u0027 again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;\u0027","006":"since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --","007":"again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,\u0027 (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,\u0027","008":"for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;","009":"there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,","010":"for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.","011":"May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,","012":"for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;","013":"and there is not a created thing not manifest

infirmity;","003":"and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;","004":"and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:","005":"so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;\u0027","006":"as also in another

tithes,","010":"for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.","011":"If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?","012":"for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,","013":"for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,","014":"for `it is\u0027 evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.","015":"And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,","016":"who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,","017":"for He doth testify -- `Thou `art\u0027 a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;\u0027","018":"for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and

which the Lord did set up, and not man,","003":"for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence `it is\u0027 necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;","004":"for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,","005":"who unto an example and shadow do

more conscience of sins, having once been purified?","003":"but in those `sacrifices\u0027 is a remembrance of sins every year,","004":"for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.","005":"Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,","006":"in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings,

he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;","010":"in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,","011":"and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.","012":"And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --","013":"as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies `as\u0027 his footstool,","014":"for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;","015":"and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,","016":"`This `is\u0027 the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord,

sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;","023":"may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful `is\u0027 He who did promise),","024":"and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,","025":"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain `is\u0027, but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.","026":"For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,","027":"but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;","028":"any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,","029":"of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?","030":"for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance `is\u0027 Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;\u0027 and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;\u0027 --","031":"fearful

ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.","035":"Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,","036":"for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,","037":"for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;","038":"and `the righteous by faith shall live,\u0027 and `if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,\u0027","039":"and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those

we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;","004":"by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth yet speak.","005":"By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased God well,","006":"and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.","007":"By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir.","008":"By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;","009":"by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,","010":"for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and constructor `is\u0027 God.","011":"By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;","012":"wherefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that `is\u0027 by the sea-shore -- the innumerable.","013":"In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted `them\u0027, and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth,","014":"for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;","015":"and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,","016":"but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city.","017":"By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises,","018":"of whom it was said -- `In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;\u0027","019":"reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive `him\u0027.","020":"By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;","021":"by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;","022":"by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command.","023":"By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king;","024":"by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,","025":"having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin\u0027s pleasure for a season,","026":"greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;","027":"by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One -- he endured;","028":"by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them.","029":"By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up;","030":"by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days;","031":"by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace.","032":"And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,","033":"who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,","034":"quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens.","035":"Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,","036":"and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;","037":"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins -- being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated,","038":"of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and `in\u0027 mountains, and `in\u0027 caves, and `in\u0027 the holes of the earth;","039":"and these all, having been testified to through the faith, did not receive the promise,","040":"God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect."},"012":{"001":"Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,","002":"looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;","003":"for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls -- being faint.","004":"Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;","005":"and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,","006":"for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;\u0027","007":"if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?","008":"and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.","009":"Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising `us\u0027, and we were reverencing `them\u0027; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?","010":"for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;","011":"and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth yield.","012":"Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up;","013":"and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;","014":"peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,","015":"looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;","016":"lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,","017":"for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it.","018":"For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,","019":"and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,","020":"for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,\u0027","021":"and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, `I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.\u0027","022":"But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,","023":"to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,","024":"and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!","025":"See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who `speaketh\u0027 from heaven,","026":"whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, `Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;\u0027","027":"and this -- `Yet once\u0027 -- doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;","028":"wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;","029":"for also our God `is\u0027 a consuming fire."},"013":{"001":"Let brotherly love remain;","002":"of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;","003":"be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body;","004":"honourable `is\u0027 the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled, and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.","005":"Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, `No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,\u0027","006":"so that we do boldly say, `The Lord `is\u0027 to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.\u0027","007":"Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,","008":"Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;","009":"with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for `it is\u0027 good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;","010":"we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving,","011":"for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp.","012":"Wherefore, also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through `his\u0027 own blood the people -- without the gate did suffer;","013":"now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;","014":"for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;","015":"through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name;","016":"and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.","017":"Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this `is\u0027 unprofitable to you.","018":"Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,","019":"and more abundantly do I call upon `you\u0027 to do this, that more quickly I may be restored to you.","020":"And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,","021":"make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom `is\u0027 the glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.","022":"And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you.","023":"Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom, if he may come more shortly, I will see you.","024":"Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you doth those from Italy:","025":"the grace `is\u0027 with you all!
