is comforting us in all our tribulation, for our being able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by God;","005":"because, as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us, so through the Christ doth abound also our comfort;","006":"and whether we be in tribulation, `it is\u0027 for your comfort and salvation, that is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings that we also suffer; whether we are comforted, `it is\u0027 for your comfort and salvation;","007":"and our hope `is\u0027 stedfast for you, knowing that even as ye are partakers of the sufferings -- so also of the comfort.","008":"For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation that happened to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly burdened above `our\u0027 power, so that we despaired even of life;","009":"but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had, that we may not be trusting on ourselves, but on God, who is raising the dead,","010":"who out of so great a death did deliver us, and doth deliver, in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver;","011":"ye working together also for us by your supplication, that the gift through many persons to us, through many may be thankfully acknowledged for us.","012":"For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we did conduct ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you;","013":"for no other things do we write to you, but what ye either do read or also acknowledge, and I hope that also unto the end ye shall acknowledge,","014":"according as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that your glory we are, even as also ye `are\u0027 ours, in the day of the

all,","004":"for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you.","005":"And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all;","006":"sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that `is\u0027 by the more part,","007":"so that, on the contrary, `it is\u0027 rather for you to forgive and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be swallowed up;","008":"wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him,","009":"for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether in regard to all things ye are obedient.","010":"And to whom ye forgive anything -- I also; for

the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart,","004":"and such trust we have through the Christ toward God,","005":"not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency `is\u0027 of God,","006":"who also made us sufficient `to be\u0027 ministrants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; for the letter doth kill, and the spirit doth make alive.","007":"and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look

the Lord `is\u0027, there `is\u0027 liberty;","018":"and we all, with unvailed face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as

good news is vailed, in those perishing it is vailed,","004":"in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving, that there doth not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God;","005":"for not ourselves do we preach, but Christ Jesus -- Lord, and ourselves your servants because of Jesus;","006":"because `it is\u0027 God who said, Out of darkness light `is\u0027 to shine, who did shine in our hearts, for the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.","007":"And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us;","008":"on every side being in tribulation, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in

grace having been multiplied, because of the thanksgiving of the more, may abound to the glory of God;","016":"wherefore, we faint not, but if also our outward man doth decay, yet the inward is renewed day by day;","017":"for the momentary light matter of our tribulation, more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory doth work out for us --","018":"we not looking to the things seen, but to the things not seen; for the things seen `are\u0027 temporary, but the things not seen `are\u0027 age-during."},"005":{"001":"For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an house not made with hands -- age-during -- in the heavens,","002":"for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves,","003":"if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be found naked,","004":"for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be swallowed up of the life.","005":"And He who did work us to this self-same thing `is\u0027 God, who also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit;","006":"having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord, --","007":"for through faith we walk, not through sight --","008":"we have courage, and are well pleased rather to be away from the home of the body, and to be at home with the Lord.","009":"Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well pleasing to him,","010":"for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things `done\u0027 through the body, in reference to the things that he did, whether good or evil;","011":"having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested;","012":"for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that ye may have `something\u0027 in reference to those glorifying in face and not in heart;","013":"for whether we were beside ourselves, `it was\u0027 to God; whether we be of sound mind -- `it is\u0027 to you,","014":"for the love of the Christ doth constrain us, having judged thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died,","015":"and for all he died, that those living, no more to themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was raised again.","016":"So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more;","017":"so that if any one `is\u0027 in Christ -- `he is\u0027 a new creature; the old things did pass away, lo, become new have the all things.","018":"And the all things `are\u0027 of God, who reconciled us to Himself through

us the word of the reconciliation,","020":"in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, `Be ye reconciled to
