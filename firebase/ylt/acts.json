go;\u0027","036":"and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- `The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;\u0027","037":"and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast `us\u0027 to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.\u0027","038":"And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,","039":"and having come, they besought them, and having brought `them\u0027 forth, they were asking `them\u0027 to go forth from the city;","040":"and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into `the house of\u0027 Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth."},"017":{"001":"And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,","002":"and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them, and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Writings,","003":"opening and alleging, `That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.\u0027","004":"And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.","005":"And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring `them\u0027 to the populace,","006":"and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- `These, having put the world in commotion, are also here present,","007":"whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.\u0027","008":"And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers, hearing these things,","009":"and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.","010":"And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews;","011":"and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so;","012":"many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women and men not a few.","013":"And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;","014":"and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining there.","015":"And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;","016":"and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,","017":"therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the market-place every day with those who met with him.","018":"And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, `What would this seed picker wish to say?\u0027 and others, `Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;\u0027 because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,","019":"having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought `him\u0027, saying, `Are we able to know what `is\u0027 this new teaching that is spoken by thee,","020":"for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;\u0027","021":"and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.","022":"And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, `Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;","023":"for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- ye do worship, this One I announce to you.","024":"`God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands doth not dwell,","025":"neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;","026":"He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --","027":"to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,","028":"for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.","029":"`Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;","030":"the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform,","031":"because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.\u0027","032":"And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, `We will hear thee again concerning this;\u0027","033":"and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,","034":"and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom `is\u0027 also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them."},"018":{"001":"And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens, came to Corinth,","002":"and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife -- because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out of Rome -- he came to them,","003":"and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft;","004":"and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.","005":"And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ;","006":"and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken `his\u0027 garments, he said unto them, `Your blood `is\u0027 upon your head -- I am clean; henceforth to the nations I will go on.\u0027","007":"And having departed thence, he went to the house of a certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue,","008":"and Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue did believe in the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing were believing, and they were being baptized.","009":"And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul, `Be not afraid, but be speaking and thou mayest be not silent;","010":"because I am with thee, and no one shall set on thee to do thee evil; because I have much people in this city;\u0027","011":"and he continued a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.","012":"And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal,","013":"saying -- `Against the law this one doth persuade men to worship God;\u0027","014":"and Paul being about to open `his\u0027 mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, `If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had borne with you,","015":"but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of your law, look ye yourselves `to it\u0027, for a judge of these things I do not wish to be,\u0027","016":"and he drave them from the tribunal;","017":"and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man of the synagogue, were beating `him\u0027 before the tribunal, and not even for these things was Gallio caring.","018":"And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria -- and with him `are\u0027 Priscilla and Aquilas -- having shorn `his\u0027 head in Cenchera, for he had a vow;","019":"and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with the Jews:","020":"and they having requested `him\u0027 to remain a longer time with them, he did not consent,","021":"but took leave of them, saying, `It behoveth me by all means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will return unto you -- God willing.\u0027 And he sailed from Ephesus,","022":"and having come down to Cesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.","023":"And having made some stay he went forth, going through in order the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.","024":"And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came to Ephesus,","025":"this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John;","026":"this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to `them\u0027, and did more exactly expound to him the way of God,","027":"and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to receive him, who having come, did help them much who have believed through the grace,","028":"for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, shewing through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ."},"019":{"001":"And it came to pass, in Apollos\u0027 being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples,","002":"he said unto them, `The Holy Spirit did ye receive -- having believed?\u0027 and they said unto him, `But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;\u0027","003":"and he said unto them, `To what, then, were ye baptized?\u0027 and they said, `To John\u0027s baptism.\u0027","004":"And Paul said, `John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ -- Jesus;\u0027","005":"and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus,","006":"and Paul having laid on them `his\u0027 hands, the Holy Spirit came upon them, they were speaking also with tongues, and prophesying,","007":"and all the men were, as it were, twelve.","008":"And having gone into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the reign of God,","009":"and when certain were hardened and were disbelieving, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he did separate the disciples, every day reasoning in the school of a certain Tyrannus.","010":"And this happened for two years so that all those dwelling in Asia did hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks,","011":"mighty works also -- not common -- was God working through the hands of Paul,","012":"so that even unto the ailing were brought from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the sicknesses departed from them; the evil spirits also went forth from them.","013":"And certain of the wandering exorcist Jews, took upon `them\u0027 to name over those having the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, `We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul doth preach;\u0027","014":"and there were certain -- seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest -- who are doing this thing;","015":"and the evil spirit, answering, said, `Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; and ye -- who are ye?\u0027","016":"And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house,","017":"and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified,","018":"many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing and declaring their acts,","019":"and many of those who had practised the curious arts, having brought the books together, were burning `them\u0027 before all; and they reckoned together the prices of them, and found `it\u0027 five myriads of silverlings;","020":"so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing.","021":"And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to Jerusalem, saying -- `After my being there, it behoveth me also to see Rome;\u0027","022":"and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to him -- Timotheus and Erastus -- he himself stayed a time in Asia.","023":"And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the way,","024":"for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver, making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the artificers gain not a little,","025":"whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who did work about such things, he said, `Men, ye know that by this work we have our wealth;","026":"and ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by hands;","027":"and not only is this department in danger for us of coming into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world doth worship.\u0027","028":"And they having heard, and having become full of wrath, were crying out, saying, `Great `is\u0027 the Artemis of the Ephesians!\u0027","029":"and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul\u0027s fellow-travellers.","030":"And on Paul\u0027s purposing to enter in unto the populace, the disciples were not suffering him,","031":"and certain also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, having sent unto him, were entreating him not to venture himself into the theatre.","032":"Some indeed, therefore, were calling out one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together;","033":"and out of the multitude they put forward Alexander -- the Jews thrusting him forward -- and Alexander having beckoned with the hand, wished to make defence to the populace,","034":"and having known that he is a Jew, one voice came out of all, for about two hours, crying, `Great `is\u0027 the Artemis of the Ephesians!\u0027","035":"And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, saith, `Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?","036":"these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.","037":"`For ye brought these men, who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your goddess;","038":"if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with him with any one have a matter, court `days\u0027 are held, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.","039":"`And if ye seek after anything concerning other matters, in the legal assembly it shall be determined;","040":"for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse;\u0027","041":"and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly."},"020":{"001":"And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced `them\u0027, went forth to go on to Macedonia;","002":"and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece;","003":"having made also three months\u0027 `stay\u0027 -- a counsel of the Jews having been against him -- being about to set forth to Syria, there came `to him\u0027 a resolution of returning through Macedonia.","004":"And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and Trophimus;","005":"these, having gone before, did remain for us in Troas,","006":"and we sailed, after the days of the unleavened food, from Philippi, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.","007":"And on the first of the week, the disciples having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, about to depart on the morrow, he was also continuing the discourse till midnight,","008":"and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together,","009":"and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus, upon the window -- being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul discoursing long -- he having sunk down from the sleep, fell down from the third story, and was lifted up dead.","010":"And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having embraced `him\u0027, said, `Make no tumult, for his life is in him;\u0027","011":"and having come up, and having broken bread, and having tasted, for a long time also having talked -- till daylight, so he went forth,","012":"and they brought up the lad alive, and were comforted in no ordinary measure.","013":"And we having gone before unto the ship, did sail to Assos, thence intending to take in Paul, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot;","014":"and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene,","015":"and thence having sailed, on the morrow we came over-against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus,","016":"for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he hasted, if it were possible for him, on the day of the Pentecost to be at Jerusalem.","017":"And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly,","018":"and when they were come unto him, he said to them, `Ye -- ye know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with you at all times I was;","019":"serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against `me\u0027;","020":"how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house,","021":"testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.","022":"`And now, lo, I -- bound in the Spirit -- go on to Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing,","023":"save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain;","024":"but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify fully the good news of the grace of God.","025":"`And now, lo, I have known that no more shall ye see my face, -- ye all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God;","026":"wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I `am\u0027 clear from the blood of all,","027":"for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.","028":"`Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood,","029":"for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,","030":"and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.","031":"`Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one;","032":"and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified.","033":"`The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;","034":"and ye yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, minister did these hands;","035":"all things I did shew you, that, thus labouring, it behoveth `us\u0027 to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\u0027","036":"And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with them all, he did pray,","037":"and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,","038":"sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said -- that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship."},"021":{"001":"And it came to pass, at our sailing, having been parted from them, having run direct, we came to Coos, and the succeeding `day\u0027 to Rhodes, and thence to Patara,","002":"and having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having gone on board, we sailed,","003":"and having discovered Cyprus, and having left it on the left, we were sailing to Syria, and did land at Tyre, for there was the ship discharging the lading.","004":"And having found out the disciples, we tarried there seven days, and they said to Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem;","005":"but when it came that we completed the days, having gone forth, we went on, all bringing us on the way, with women and children, unto the outside of the city, and having bowed the knees upon the shore, we prayed,","006":"and having embraced one another, we embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own friends.","007":"And we, having finished the course, from Tyre came down to Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them;","008":"and on the morrow Paul and his company having gone forth, we came to Cesarea, and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist -- who is of the seven --

Agabus,","011":"and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, `Thus saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so

Lord Jesus;\u0027","014":"and he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, `The will of the Lord be done.\u0027","015":"And after these days, having taken `our\u0027 vessels, we were going up to

Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly receive us,","018":"and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James, all the elders also came,","019":"and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one,
