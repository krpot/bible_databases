Now that day was the Sabbath.","010":"So the Jews said to the man who had been made well, It is the Sabbath; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed.","011":"He said to them, But he who made me well, said to me, Take up your bed and go.","012":"Then they put to him the question: Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and go?","013":"Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was, Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place.","014":"After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.","015":"The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.","016":"And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.","017":"But his answer was: My Father is still working even now, and so I am working.","018":"For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.","019":"So Jesus made answer and said, Truly I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything himself; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way.","020":"For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.","021":"In the same way, as the Father gives life to the dead, even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it.","022":"The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;","023":"So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father.

He who comes to me will never be in need of food, and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink.","036":"But it is as I said to you: you have seen me, and still you have no faith.","037":"Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me.","038":"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my pleasure, but the pleasure of him who sent me.","039":"And this is the pleasure of him who sent me, that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me, but I am to give it new life on the last day.","040":"This, I say, is my Father\u0027s pleasure, that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life: and I will take him up on the last day.","041":"Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words, I am the bread which came down from heaven.","042":"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have seen? How is it then that he now says, I have come down from heaven?","043":"Jesus made answer and said, Do not say things against me, one to another.","044":"No man is able to come to me if the Father who sent me does not give him the desire to come: and I will take him up from the dead on the last day.","045":"The writings of the prophets say, And they will all have teaching from God. Everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the Father comes to me.","046":"Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only he who is from God, he has seen the Father.","047":"Truly I say to you, He who has faith in me has eternal life.","048":"I am the bread of life.","049":"Your fathers took the manna in the waste land--and they are dead.","050":"The bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death.","051":"I am the living bread which has come from heaven: if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever: and more than this, the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.","052":"Then the Jews had an angry discussion among themselves, saying, How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food?","053":"Then Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, If you do not take the flesh of the Son of man for food, and if you do not take his blood for drink, you have no life in you.","054":"He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life: and I will take him up from the dead at the last day.","055":"My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","056":"He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him.","057":"As the living Father has sent me, and I have life because of the Father, even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me.","058":"This is the bread which has come down from heaven. It is not like the food which your fathers had: they took of the manna, and are dead; but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever.","059":"Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum.","060":"Then, hearing this, a number of his disciples said, This is a hard saying; who is able to take in such teaching?","061":"When Jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said, he said to them, Does this give you trouble?","062":"What then will you say if you see the Son of man going up to where he was before?","063":"The spirit is the life giver; the flesh is of no value: the words which I have said to you are spirit and they are life.","064":"But still some of you have no faith. For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith, and who it was who would be false to him.","065":"And he said, This is why I said to you, No man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the Father.","066":"Because of what he said, a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him.","067":"So Jesus said to the twelve, Have you a desire to go away?","068":"Then Simon Peter gave this answer: Lord, to whom are we to go? you have the words of eternal life;","069":"And we have faith and are certain that you are the Holy One of God.","070":"Then Jesus said, Did I not make a selection of you, the twelve, and one of you is a son of the Evil One?","071":"He was talking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. It was he who was to be false to Jesus--one of the twelve."},"007":{"001":"After this, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee. He did not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to death.","002":"But the feast of the Jews, the feast of tents, was near.","003":"So his brothers said to him, Go away from here into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do.","004":"Because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him. If you do these things, let yourself be seen by all men.","005":"For even his brothers had no belief in him.","006":"Jesus said to them, My time is still to come, but any time is good for you.","007":"It is not possible for you to be hated by the world; but I am hated by it, because I give witness that what it does is evil.","008":"Go you up to the feast: I am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come.","009":"Having said these things to them, he still kept in Galilee.","010":"But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he went up, not publicly, but in secret.","011":"At the feast the Jews were looking for him and saying, Where is he?","012":"And there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people. Some said, He is a good man; but others said, No, he is giving people false ideas.","013":"But no man said anything about him openly for fear of the Jews.","014":"Now in the middle of the feast Jesus went up to the Temple and was teaching.","015":"Then the Jews were surprised and said, How has this man got knowledge of books? He has never been to school.","016":"Jesus gave them this answer: It is not my teaching, but his who sent me.","017":"If any man is ready to do God\u0027s pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes from--from God or from myself.","018":"The man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself, but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him--that man is true and there is no evil in him.","019":"Did not Moses give you the law? Even so, not one of you keeps the law. Why have you a desire to put me to death?","020":"The people said in answer, You have an evil spirit: who has any desire to put you to death?","021":"This was the answer of Jesus: I have done one work and you are all surprised at it.","022":"Moses gave you circumcision--not that it comes from Moses, but from the fathers--and even on the Sabbath you give a child circumcision.","023":"If a child is given circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?","024":"Let not your decisions be based on what you see, but on righteousness.","025":"Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the man whose death is desired?","026":"And here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the Christ?","027":"However, it is clear to us where this man comes from: but when the Christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from.","028":"Then, when he was teaching in the Temple, Jesus said with a loud voice, You have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where I come from; and I have not come of myself; but there is One who has sent me; he is true, but you have no knowledge of him.","029":"I have knowledge of him because I came from him and he sent me.","030":"Then they had a desire to take him: but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come.","031":"And numbers of the people had belief in him, and they said, When the Christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done?","032":"This discussion of the people came to the ears of the Pharisees; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent servants to take him.","033":"Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little longer and then I go to him who sent me.","034":"You will be looking for me, and you will not see me: and where I am you may not come.","035":"So the Jews said among themselves, To what place is he going where we will not see him? will he go to the Jews living among the Greeks and become the teacher of the Greeks?","036":"What is this saying of his, You will be looking for me and will not see me, and where I am you may not come?","037":"On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus got up and said in a loud voice, If any man is in need of drink let him come to me and I will give it to him.","038":"He who has faith in me, out of his body, as the Writings have said, will come rivers of living water.","039":"This he said of the Spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him: the Spirit had not been given then, because the glory of Jesus was still to come.","040":"When these words came to their ears, some of the people said, This is certainly the prophet.","041":"Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Not so; will the Christ come from Galilee?","042":"Do not the Writings say that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Beth-lehem, the little town where David was?","043":"So there was a division among the people because of him.","044":"And some of them had a desire to take him; but no man put hands on him.","045":"Then the servants went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why have you not got him with you?","046":"The servants made answer, No man ever said things like this man.","047":"Then the Pharisees said to them, Have you, like the others, been given false ideas?","048":"Have any of the rulers belief in him, or any one of the Pharisees?","049":"But these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed.","050":"Nicodemus--he who had come to Jesus before, being himself one of them--said to them,","051":"Is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done?","052":"This was their answer: And do you come from Galilee? Make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.","053":"[And every man went to his house;"},"008":{"001":"But Jesus went to the Mountain of Olives.","002":"And early in the morning he came again into the Temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them.","003":"Now the scribes and Pharisees came, with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation;","004":"And putting her forward, they said to him, Master, this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation.","005":"Now in the law Moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned; what do you say about it?","006":"They said this, testing him, so that they might have something against him. But Jesus, with his head bent down, made letters on the floor with his finger.","007":"But when they went on with their questions, he got up and said to them, Let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her.","008":"And again, with bent head, he made letters on the floor.","009":"And when his words came to their ears, they went out one by one, starting with the oldest even to the last, because they were conscious of what was in their hearts: and Jesus was there by himself with the woman before him.","010":"Then Jesus got up, and seeing nobody but the woman, he said to her, Where are the men who said things against you? did no one give a decision against you?","011":"And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, And I do not give a decision against you: go, and never do wrong again.]","012":"Then again Jesus said to them, I am the light of the world; he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life.","013":"So the Pharisees said to him, The witness you give is about yourself: your witness is not true.","014":"Jesus said in answer, Even if I give witness about myself, my witness is true, because I have knowledge of where I came from and where I am going; but you have no knowledge of where I come from or of where I am going.","015":"You are judging from what you see; I am judging no man.","016":"Even if I am judging, my decision is right, because I am not by myself--with me is the Father who sent me.","017":"Even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true.","018":"I give witness about myself and the Father who sent me gives witness about me.","019":"Then they said to him, Where is your Father? Jesus said in answer, You have no knowledge of me or of my Father: if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my Father.","020":"Jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored, while he was teaching in the Temple: but no man took him because his time was still to come.","021":"Then he said to them again, I am going away and you will be looking for me, but death will overtake you in your sins. It is not possible for you to come where I am going.","022":"So the Jews said, Will he take his life? Is that why he says, Where I go it is not possible for you to come?","023":"And he said to them, You are of the earth; I am from heaven: you are of this world; I am not of this world.","024":"For this reason I said to you that death will overtake you in your sins: for if you have not faith that I am he, death will come to you while you are in your sins.","025":"Then they said to him, Who are you? Jesus said, What I said to you from the first.","026":"I have much to say about you and against you: but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me I say to the world.","027":"They did not see that his words were about the Father.","028":"So Jesus said, When the Son of man has been lifted up by you, then it will be clear to you who I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but say as the Father gave me teaching.","029":"He who sent me is with me; he has not gone from me, because at all times I do the things which are pleasing to him.","030":"When he said this a number came to have faith in him.","031":"Then Jesus said to the Jews who had faith in him, If you keep my word, then you are truly my disciples;","032":"And you will have knowledge of what is true, and that will make you free.","033":"They said to him in answer, We are Abraham\u0027s seed and have never been any man\u0027s servant: why do you say, You will become free?","034":"And this was the answer Jesus gave them: Truly I say to you, Everyone who does evil is the servant of sin.","035":"Now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever, but the son does.","036":"If then the son makes you free, you will be truly free.","037":"I am conscious that you are Abraham\u0027s seed; but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you.","038":"I say the things which I have seen in my Father\u0027s house: and you do the things which come to you from your father\u0027s house.","039":"In answer they said to him, Our father is Abraham.

It is because your ears are shut to my teaching.","044":"You are the children of your father the Evil One and it is your pleasure to do his desires.

If I say what is true, why have you no belief in me?","047":"He who is a child of God gives ear to the words of God: your ears are not open to them because you are not from God.","048":"The Jews said to him in answer, Are we not right in saying that you are of Samaria and have an evil spirit?","049":"And this was the answer of Jesus: I have not an evil spirit; but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me.","050":"I, however, am not in search of glory for myself: there is One who is searching for it and he is judge.","051":"Truly I say to you, If a man keeps my word he will never see death.","052":"The Jews said to him, Now we are certain that you have an evil spirit. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead; and you say, If a man keeps my word he will never see death.","053":"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: who do you say that you are?","054":"Jesus said in answer, If I take glory for myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who gives me glory, of whom you say that he is your God.","055":"You have no knowledge of him, but I have knowledge of him; and if I said I have no knowledge of him I would be talking falsely like you: but I have full knowledge of him, and I keep his word.","056":"Your father Abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day: he saw it and was glad.","057":"Then the Jews said to him, You are not fifty years old; have you seen Abraham?","058":"Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.","059":"So they took up stones to send at him: but Jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the Temple."},"009":{"001":"And when he went on his way, he saw a man blind from birth.","002":"And his disciples put a question to him, saying, Master, was it because of this man\u0027s sin, or the sin of his father and mother, that he has been blind from birth?","003":"Jesus said in answer, It was not because of his sin, or because of his father\u0027s or mother\u0027s; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him.","004":"While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me: the night comes when no work may be done.","005":"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.","006":"Having said these words, he put earth, mixed with water from his mouth, on the man\u0027s eyes,","007":"And said to him, Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam (the sense of the name is, Sent).

Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.","017":"Again they said to the blind man, What have you to say about him for opening your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.","018":"Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see, till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open,","019":"And put the question to them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was blind at birth? how is it then that he is now able to see?","020":"In answer his father and mother said, We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth:","021":"But how it is he is now able to see, or who made his eyes open, we are not able to say: put the question to him; he is old enough to give an answer for himself.","022":"They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.","023":"That was the reason why they said, He is old enough; put the question to him.","024":"So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him, Give glory to God: it is clear to us that this man is a sinner.","025":"He said in answer, I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not, but one thing I am certain about; I was blind, and now I see.","026":"Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did he give you the use of your eyes?","027":"His answer was: I have said it before, but your ears were shut: why would you have me say it again? is it your desire to become his disciples?","028":"And they were angry with him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.","029":"We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.","030":"The man said in answer, Why, here is a strange thing! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes.","031":"We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners, but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure, to him God\u0027s ears are open.","032":"In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open.","033":"If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything.","034":"Their answer was: You came to birth through sin; do you make yourself our teacher?

If you are the Christ, say so clearly.","025":"Jesus said in answer, I have said it and you have no belief: the works which I do in my Father\u0027s name, these give witness about me.","026":"But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep.","027":"My sheep give ear to my voice, and I have knowledge of them, and they come after me:","028":"And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand.","029":"That which my Father has given to me has more value than all; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father\u0027s hand.","030":"I and my Father are one.","031":"Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him.","032":"Jesus said to them in answer, I have let you see a number of good works from the Father; for which of those works are you stoning me?","033":"This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God.","034":"In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods?","035":"If he said they were gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Writings may not be broken),","036":"Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, Your words are evil; because I said, I am God\u0027s Son?","037":"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not have belief in me;","038":"But if I am doing them, then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.","039":"Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them.","040":"And he went again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John first gave baptism; and he was there for a time.","041":"And a great number of people came to him, saying, John did no sign: but everything John said of this man was true.","042":"And a number came to have faith in him there."},"011":{"001":"Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.","002":"(The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who put perfumed oil on the Lord and made his feet dry with her hair.)","003":"So the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, your dear friend is ill.","004":"When this came to his ears, Jesus said, The end of this disease is not death, but the glory of God, so that the Son of God may have glory because of it.","005":"Now Jesus had love in his heart for Martha and her sister and Lazarus.","006":"So when the news came to him that Lazarus was ill, he did not go from the place where he was for two days.","007":"Then after that time he said to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.","008":"The disciples said to him, Master, the Jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned, and are you going back there again?","009":"Then Jesus said in answer, Are there not twelve hours in the day? A man may go about in the day without falling, because he sees the light of this world.","010":"But if a man goes about in the night, he may have a fall because the light is not in him.","011":"These things said he: and after that he said to them, Lazarus our friend is at rest; but I go so that I may make him come out of his sleep.","012":"Then his disciples said to him, Lord, if he is resting he will get well.","013":"Jesus, however, was talking of his death: but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep.","014":"Then Jesus said to them clearly, Lazarus is dead.","015":"And because of you I am glad I was not there, so that you may have faith; but let us go to him.","016":"Then Thomas, who was named Didymus, said to the other disciples, Let us go so that we may be with him in death.","017":"Now when Jesus came, he made the discovery that Lazarus had been put into the earth four days before.","018":"Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about two miles away;","019":"And a number of Jews had come to Martha and Mary to give them comfort about their brother.","020":"When Martha had the news that Jesus was on the way, she went out to him, but Mary did not go from the house.","021":"Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead.","022":"But I am certain that, even now, whatever request you make to God, God will give it to you.","023":"Jesus said to her, Your brother will come to life again.","024":"Martha said to him, I am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day.","025":"Jesus said to her, I am myself that day and that life; he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead;","026":"And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death. Is this your faith?","027":"She said to him, Yes, Lord: my faith is that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.","028":"And having said this, she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary, The Master is here and has sent for you.","029":"And Mary, hearing this, got up quickly and went to him.","030":"Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha had seen him.","031":"Then the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out, went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there.","032":"When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she went down at his feet, saying, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead.","033":"And when Jesus saw her weeping, and saw the Jews weeping who came with her, his spirit was moved and he was troubled,","034":"And said, Where have you put him? They said, Come and see, Lord.","035":"And Jesus himself was weeping.","036":"So the Jews said, See how dear he was to him!","037":"But some of them said, This man, who made open the eyes of the blind man, was he not able to keep his friend from death?","038":"So Jesus, deeply troubled in heart, came to the place of the dead. It was a hole in the rock, and a stone was over the opening.","039":"Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said, Lord, by this time the body will be smelling, for he has been dead four days.","040":"Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God?","041":"So they took away the stone. And Jesus, looking up to heaven, said, Father, I give praise to you for hearing me.","042":"I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me, but I said it because of these who are here, so that they may see that you sent me.","043":"Then he said in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!","044":"And he who was dead came out, with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet, and a cloth about his face. Jesus said to them, Make him free and let him go.","045":"Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him.","046":"But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done.","047":"Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said, What are we doing? This man is doing a number of signs.","048":"If we let him go on in this way, everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.","049":"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You have no knowledge of anything;","050":"You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people, so that all the nation may not come to destruction.","051":"He did not say this of himself, but being the high priest that year he said, as a prophet, that Jesus would be put to death for the nation;","052":"And not for that nation only, but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world.","053":"And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death.","054":"So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near to the waste land, to a town named Ephraim, where he was for some time with the disciples.","055":"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover.","056":"They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple, What is your opinion? Will he not come to the feast?","057":"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was, he was to give them word, so that they might take him."},"012":{"001":"Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead.","002":"So they made him a meal there, and he was waited on by Martha, and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table.","003":"Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.","004":"But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,","005":"Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence, and the money given to the poor?","006":"(He said this, not because he had any love for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the money-bag, took for himself what was put into it.)","007":"Then Jesus said, Let her be. Let her keep what she has for the day of my death.","008":"The poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.","009":"Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there: and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life.","010":"Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death;","011":"For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus.","012":"The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,","013":"Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!","014":"And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it; as the Writings say,","015":"Have no fear, daughter of Zion: see your King is coming, seated on a young ass.","016":"(These things were not clear to his disciples at first: but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory, then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him.)","017":"Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead, and gave him life again, had been talking about it.","018":"And that was the reason the people went out to him, because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign.","019":"Then the Pharisees said one to another, You see, you are unable to do anything: the world has gone after him.","020":"Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast:","021":"They came to Philip, who was of Beth-saida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.","022":"Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus.","023":"And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come.","024":"Truly I say to you, If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end, it is still a seed and no more; but through its death it gives much fruit.","025":"He who is in love with life will have it taken from him; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever.","026":"If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour.","027":"Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour. No: for this purpose have I come to this hour.","028":"Father, give glory to your name. Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again.","029":"Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.","030":"Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you.","031":"Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out.","032":"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me.","033":"(This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)","034":"Then the people in answer said to him, The law says that the Christ will have life without end: how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?","035":"Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light will be among you; while you have the light go on walking in it, so that the dark may not overtake you: one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going.","036":"In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.","037":"But though he had done such a number of signs before them, they still had no belief in him:","038":"So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true, when he said, Lord, who has any belief in our preaching? and the arm of the Lord, to whom has it been unveiled?","039":"For this reason they were unable to have belief, because Isaiah said again,","040":"He has made their eyes blind, and their hearts hard; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts, and be changed, and I might make them well.","041":"(Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory. His words were about him.)","042":"However, a number even of the rulers had belief in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue:","043":"For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God.","044":"Then Jesus said with a loud voice, He who has faith in me, has faith not in me, but in him who sent me.","045":"And he who sees me, sees him who sent me.","046":"I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.","047":"And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world.","048":"He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart, is not without a judge: the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day.","049":"For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it.","050":"And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me."},"013":{"001":"Now before the feast of the Passover, it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father.

Peter said, Lord, are my feet to be washed by you?","007":"And Jesus, answering, said to him, What I do is not clear to you now, but it will be clear to you in time to come.","008":"Peter said, I will never let my feet be washed by you, never. Jesus said in answer, If I do not make you clean you have no part with me.","009":"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.","010":"Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over: and you, my disciples, are clean, but not all of you.","011":"(He had knowledge who was false to him; that is why he said, You are not all clean.)","012":"Then, after washing their feet and putting on his robe again, he took his seat and said to them, Do you see what I have done to you?","013":"You give me the name of Master and Lord: and you are right; that is what I am.","014":"If then I, the Lord and the Master, have made your feet clean, it is right for you to make one another\u0027s feet clean.","015":"I have given you an example, so that you may do what I have done to you.","016":"Truly I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him.","017":"If these things are clear to you, happy are you if you do them.","018":"I am not talking of you all: I have knowledge of my true disciples, but things are as they are, so that the Writings may come true, The foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me.","019":"From this time forward, I give you knowledge of things before they come about, so that when they come about you may have belief that I am he.","020":"Truly I say to you, He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send, takes me to his heart; and he who so takes me, takes him who sent me.","021":"When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit, and gave witness, saying, Truly I say to you, that one of you will be false to me.","022":"Then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another, in doubt as to whom he had in mind.","023":"There was at table one of his disciples, the one dear to Jesus, resting his head on Jesus\u0027 breast.","024":"Making a sign to him, Simon Peter said, Who is it he is talking about?","025":"He, then, resting his head on Jesus\u0027 breast, said to him, Lord, who is it?","026":"This was the answer Jesus gave: It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel. Then he took the bit of bread, put it into the vessel, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.","027":"And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him. Then Jesus said to him, Do quickly what you have to do.","028":"Now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him.","029":"Some were of the opinion that because Judas kept the money-bag Jesus said to him, Get the things we have need of for the feast; or, that he was to give something to the poor.","030":"So Judas, having taken the bit of bread, straight away went out: and it was night.","031":"Then when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is glory given to the Son of man, and God is given glory in him.","032":"If God is given glory in him, God will give him glory in himself, and will give him glory even now.","033":"My dear children, I am only to be with you a little longer.

Jesus said in answer, Where I am going you may not come with me now, but you will come later.","037":"Peter said to him, Why may I not come with you even now?

She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.","016":"Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master).","017":"Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.","018":"Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her.","019":"At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you!","020":"And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.","021":"And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.","022":"And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:","023":"Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins.","024":"Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","025":"So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord.

They made answer, No.","006":"And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.","007":"So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.","008":"And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.","009":"When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.","010":"Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.","011":"So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.","012":"Jesus said to them, Come and take some food.

He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.","016":"Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.","017":"He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.","018":"Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.","019":"Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.","020":"Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?","021":"Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?","022":"Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.","023":"So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?","024":"This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.","025":"And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be."}}
