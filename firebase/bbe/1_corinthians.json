where is he who has knowledge of the law? where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?","021":"For because, by the purpose of God, the world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God\u0027s pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those who had faith in him.","022":"Seeing that the Jews make request for signs, and the Greeks are looking for knowledge:","023":"But we give the good news of Christ on the cross, a hard thing to the Jews, and a foolish thing to the Gentiles;","024":"But to those of God\u0027s selection, Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power and the wisdom of God.","025":"Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men.","026":"For you see God\u0027s design for you, my brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh, not the strong, not the noble:","027":"But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame; and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong;","028":"And the low things of the world, and the things without honour, did God make selection of, yes, even the things which are not, so that he might make as nothing the things which are:","029":"So that no flesh might have glory before God.","030":"But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation, and made us holy:","031":"So that, as it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord."},"002":{"001":"And when I came to you, my brothers, I did not come with wise words of knowledge, putting before you the secret of God.","002":"For I had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross.","003":"And I was with you without strength, in fear and in doubt.","004":"And in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom, but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make it clear to you:","005":"So that your faith might be based not on man\u0027s wisdom but on the power of God.","006":"But still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge, though not the wisdom of this world, and not of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing:","007":"But we give the news of the secret wisdom of God, which he had kept in store before the world came into existence, for our glory;","008":"Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge: for if they had, they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross:","009":"But as it says in the holy Writings, Things which the eye saw not, and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man, such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him.","010":"But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit, for the Spirit makes search into all things, even the deep things of God.","011":"For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him?

Is it for the oxen that God is giving orders?","010":"Or has he us in mind? Yes, it was said for us; because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope, and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it.","011":"If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you, does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world?","012":"If others have a part in this right over you, have we not even more?
