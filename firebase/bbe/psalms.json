and waters came flowing down like rivers.","017":"And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land;","018":"Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire.","019":"They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land?","020":"See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams;

and frogs for their destruction.","046":"He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts.","047":"He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold.","048":"Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.","049":"He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them.","050":"He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease.","051":"He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;","052":"But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock.","053":"He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea.","054":"And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his;","055":"Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place.","056":"But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws;","057":"Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.","058":"They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.","059":"When this came to God\u0027s ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely;","060":"So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men;","061":"And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.","062":"He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.","063":"Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song.","064":"Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them.","065":"Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine.","066":"His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever.","067":"And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim;","068":"But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure.","069":"And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever.","070":"He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;","071":"From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage.","072":"So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands."},"079":{"001":"\u0026lt;A Psalm.
