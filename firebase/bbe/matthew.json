And they came out, and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water.","033":"And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything, and of the men who had the evil spirits.","034":"And all the town came out to Jesus; and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country."},"009":{"001":"And he got into a boat and went across and came to his town.","002":"And they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving; and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man who was ill, Son, take heart; you have forgiveness for your sins.","003":"And some of the scribes said among themselves, This man has no respect for God.","004":"And Jesus, having knowledge of what was in their minds, said, Why are your thoughts evil?","005":"For which is the simpler, to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go?","006":"But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (then said he to the man who was ill,) Get up, and take up your bed, and go to your house.","007":"And he got up and went away to his house.","008":"But when the people saw it they were full of fear, and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men.","009":"And when Jesus was going from there, he saw a man whose name was Matthew, seated at the place where taxes were taken; and he said to him, Come after me. And he got up and went after him.","010":"And it came about, when he was in the house taking food, that a number of tax-farmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples.","011":"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Master take food with tax-farmers and sinners?","012":"But on hearing this he said, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.","013":"But go and take to heart the sense of these words, My desire is for mercy, not offerings: for I have come not to get the upright, but sinners.","014":"Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food, but your disciples do not?","015":"And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of the newly-married man be sad as long as he is with them? But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then will they go without food.","016":"And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat, for by pulling away from the old, it makes a worse hole.","017":"And men do not put new wine into old wine-skins; or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out, and the skins are of no more use: but they put new wine into new wine-skins, and so the two will be safe.","018":"While he was saying these things to them, there came a ruler and gave him worship, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and put your hand on her, and she will come back to life.","019":"And Jesus got up and went after him, and so did his disciples.","020":"And a woman, who for twelve years had had a flow of blood, came after him, and put her hand on the edge of his robe:","021":"Because, she said to herself, if I may but put my hand on his robe, I will be made well.","022":"But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Daughter, take heart; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.","023":"And when Jesus came into the ruler\u0027s house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise,","024":"He said, Make room; for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they were laughing at him.","025":"But when the people were sent out, he went in and took her by the hand; and the girl got up.","026":"And the news of it went out into all that land.","027":"And when Jesus went on from there, two blind men came after him, crying out, Have mercy on us, you Son of David.","028":"And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, Have you faith that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.","029":"Then he put his hand on their eyes, saying, As your faith is, let it be done to you.","030":"And their eyes were made open. And Jesus said to them sharply, Let no man have knowledge of it.","031":"But they went out and gave news of him in all that land.","032":"And while they were going away, there came to him a man without the power of talking, and with an evil spirit.","033":"And when the evil spirit had been sent out, the man had the power of talking: and they were all surprised, saying, Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.","034":"But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of evil spirits, he sends evil spirits out of men.","035":"And Jesus went about all the towns and small places, teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain.","036":"But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them, because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper.","037":"Then he said to his disciples, There is much grain but not enough men to get it in.","038":"Make prayer, then, to the Lord of the grain-fields, that he may send out workers to get in his grain."},"010":{"001":"And he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits, and of making well all sorts of disease and pain.","002":"Now the names of the twelve are these: The first, Simon, who is named Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother;","003":"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew, the tax-farmer; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;","004":"Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who was false to him.","005":"These twelve Jesus sent out and gave them orders, saying, Do not go among the Gentiles, or into any town of Samaria,","006":"But go to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel,","007":"And, on your way, say, The kingdom of heaven is near.","008":"Make well those who are ill, give life to the dead, make lepers clean, send evil spirits out of men; freely it has been given to you, freely give.","009":"Take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets;","010":"Take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick: for the workman has a right to his food.","011":"And into whatever town or small place you go, make search there for someone who is respected, and make his house your resting-place till you go away.","012":"And when you go in, say, May peace be on this house.","013":"And if the house is good enough, let your peace come on it: but if not, let your peace come back to you.","014":"And whoever will not take you in, or give ear to your words, when you go out from that house or that town, put off its dust from your feet.","015":"Truly I say to you, It will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of God\u0027s judging than for that town.","016":"See, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Be then as wise as snakes, and as gentle as doves.","017":"But be on the watch against men: for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins, and in their Synagogues they will give you blows;","018":"And you will come before rulers and kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.","019":"But when you are given up into their hands, do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it: for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you;","020":"Because it is not you who say the words, but the Spirit of your Father in you.","021":"And brother will give up brother to death, and the father his child: and children will go against their fathers and mothers, and put them to death.","022":"And you will be hated by all men because of my name: but he who is strong to the end will have salvation.","023":"But when they are cruel to you in one town, go in flight to another: for truly, I say to you, You will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes.","024":"A disciple is not greater than his master, or a servant than his lord.","025":"It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house, how much more to those of his house!","026":"Have, then, no fear of them: because nothing is covered which will not come to light, or secret which will not be made clear.","027":"What I say to you in the dark, say in the light: and what comes to your ear secretly, say publicly from the house-tops.","028":"And have no fear of those who put to death the body, but are not able to put to death the soul. But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell.","029":"Are not sparrows two a farthing? and not one of them comes to an end without your Father:","030":"But the hairs of your head are all numbered.","031":"Then have no fear; you are of more value than a flock of sparrows.","032":"To everyone, then, who gives witness to me before men, I will give witness before my Father in heaven.","033":"But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me, I will say that I have no knowledge of him before my Father in heaven.","034":"Do not have the thought that I have come to send peace on the earth; I came not to send peace but a sword.","035":"For I have come to put a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:","036":"And a man will be hated by those of his house.","037":"He who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me; he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me.","038":"And he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me.","039":"He who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him.","040":"He who gives honour to you gives honour to me; and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me.","041":"He who gives honour to a prophet, in the name of a prophet, will be given a prophet\u0027s reward; and he who gives honour to an upright man, in the name of an upright man, will be given an upright man\u0027s reward.","042":"And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not go without his reward."},"011":{"001":"And it came about that when Jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples, he went away from there, teaching and preaching in their towns.","002":"Now when John had news in prison of the works of the Christ, he sent his disciples","003":"To say to him, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?","004":"And Jesus, answering, said to them, Go and give news to John of the things which you are seeing and hearing:","005":"The blind see; those who were not able to, are walking; lepers are made clean; those who were without hearing, now have their ears open; the dead come to life again, and the poor have the good news given to them.","006":"And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me.","007":"And when they were going away, Jesus, talking of John, said to all the people, What went you out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?","008":"But what went you out to see? a man delicately clothed? Those who have fair robes are in kings\u0027 houses.","009":"But why did you go out? to see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.","010":"This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you.","011":"Truly I say to you, Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist: but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","012":"And from the days of John the Baptist till now, the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in, and men of force take it.","013":"For all the prophets and the law were in force till John.","014":"And if you are able to see it, this is Elijah who was to come.","015":"He who has ears, let him give ear.","016":"But what comparison may I make of this generation? It is like children seated in the market-places, crying out to one another,","017":"We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief.","018":"For John came, taking no food or drink, and they say, He has an evil spirit.","019":"The Son of man has come feasting, and they say, See, a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners! And wisdom is judged to be right by her works.","020":"Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done, because they had not been turned from their sins.","021":"Unhappy are you, Chorazin! Unhappy are you, Beth-saida! For if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by, clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads.","022":"But I say to you, It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging, than for you.","023":"And you, Capernaum, were you not to be lifted up to heaven? you will go down into hell: for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been here to this day.","024":"But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging, than for you.","025":"At that time Jesus made answer and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children.","026":"Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing in your eyes.","027":"All things have been given to me by my Father; and no one has knowledge of the Son, but the Father; and no one has knowledge of the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear.","028":"Come to me, all you who are troubled and weighted down with care, and I will give you rest.","029":"Take my yoke on you and become like me, for I am gentle and without pride, and you will have rest for your souls;","030":"For my yoke is good, and the weight I take up is not hard."},"012":{"001":"At that time Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day; and his disciples, being in need of food, were taking the heads of grain.","002":"But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, See, your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the Sabbath.","003":"But he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need of food, and those who were with him?","004":"How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take, but only for the priests?","005":"Or is it not said in the law, how the Sabbath is broken by the priests in the Temple and they do no wrong?","006":"But I say to you that a greater thing than the Temple is here.","007":"But if these words had been in your minds, My desire is for mercy and not for offerings, you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong.","008":"For the Son of man is lord of the Sabbath.","009":"And he went from there into their Synagogue:","010":"And there was a man with a dead hand. And they put a question to him, saying, Is it right to make a man well on the Sabbath day? so that they might have something against him.","011":"And he said to them, Which of you, having a sheep, if it gets into a hole on the Sabbath day, will not put out a helping hand and get it back?","012":"Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! For this reason it is right to do good on the Sabbath day.","013":"Then said he to the man, Put out your hand. And he put it out, and it was made as well as the other.","014":"But the Pharisees went out and made designs against him, how they might put him to death.","015":"And Jesus, having knowledge of this, went away from there, and a great number went after him; and he made them all well,","016":"Ordering them not to give people word of him:","017":"So that what was said by Isaiah the prophet might come true,","018":"See my servant, the man of my selection, my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit on him, and he will make my decision clear to the Gentiles.","019":"His coming will not be with fighting or loud cries; and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets.","020":"The crushed stem will not be broken by him; and the feebly burning light will he not put out, till he has made righteousness overcome all.","021":"And in his name will the Gentiles put their hope.","022":"Then they took to him one with an evil spirit, who was blind and had no power of talking: and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing.","023":"And all the people were surprised and said, Is not this the Son of David?","024":"But the Pharisees, hearing of it, said, This man only sends evil spirits out of men by Beelzebub, the ruler of evil spirits.","025":"And having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them, Every kingdom having division in itself is made waste, and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction.","026":"And if Satan sends out Satan, he makes war against himself; how then will he keep his kingdom?","027":"And if I by Beelzebub send evil spirits out of men, by whom do your sons send them out? So let them be your judges.","028":"But if I by the Spirit of God send out evil spirits, then is the kingdom of God come on you.","029":"Or how may one go into a strong man\u0027s house and take his goods, if he does not first put cords round the strong man? and then he may take his goods.","030":"Whoever is not with me is against me; and he who does not take part with me in getting people together, is driving them away.","031":"So I say to you, Every sin and every evil word against God will have forgiveness; but for evil words against the Spirit there will be no forgiveness.","032":"And whoever says a word against the Son of man, will have forgiveness; but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit, will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come.","033":"Make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree.","034":"You offspring of snakes, how are you, being evil, able to say good things? because out of the heart\u0027s store come the words of the mouth.","035":"The good man out of his good store gives good things; and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things.","036":"And I say to you that in the day when they are judged, men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said.","037":"For by your words will your righteousness be seen, and by your words you will be judged.","038":"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees, hearing this, said to him, Master, we are looking for a sign from you.","039":"But he, answering, said to them, An evil and false generation is looking for a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah:","040":"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","041":"The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation: because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of Jonah; and now a greater than Jonah is here.","042":"The queen of the South will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation: for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon; and now a greater than Solomon is here.","043":"But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, goes through dry places looking for rest, and getting it not.","044":"Then he says, I will go back into my house from which I came out; and when he comes, he sees that there is no one in it, but that it has been made fair and clean.","045":"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself, and they go in and make it their living-place: and the last condition of that man is worse than the first. Even so will it be with this evil generation.","046":"While he was still talking to the people, his mother and his brothers came, desiring to have talk with him.","047":"And one said to him, See, your mother and your brothers are outside, desiring to have talk with you.","048":"But he in answer said to him who gave the news, Who is my mother and who are my brothers?","049":"And he put out his hand to his disciples and said, See, my mother and my brothers!","050":"For whoever does the pleasure of my Father in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother."},"013":{"001":"On that day Jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside.","002":"And great numbers of people came together to him, so that he got into a boat; and the people took up their position by the sea.","003":"And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, A man went out to put seed in the earth;","004":"And while he did so, some seeds were dropped by the wayside, and the birds came and took them for food:","005":"And some of the seed went among the stones, where it had not much earth, and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep:","006":"And when the sun was high, it was burned; and because it had no root it became dry and dead.","007":"And some seeds went among thorns, and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth:","008":"And some, falling on good earth, gave fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.","009":"He who has ears, let him give ear.","010":"And the disciples came and said to him, Why do you say things to them in the form of stories?","011":"And he said to them in answer, To you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.","012":"Because whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have more; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.","013":"For this reason I put things into the form of stories; because they see without seeing, and give ear without hearing, and the sense is not clear to them.","014":"And for them the words of Isaiah have come true, Though you give ear, you will not get knowledge; and seeing, you will see, but the sense will not be clear to you:","015":"For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me, so that I might make them well.","016":"But a blessing be on your eyes, because they see; and on your ears, because they are open.","017":"For truly, I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see, and saw them not; and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears, and they had it not.","018":"Give ear, then, to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth.","019":"When the word of the kingdom comes to anyone, and the sense of it is not clear to him, then the Evil One comes, and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart. He is the seed dropped by the wayside.","020":"And that which went on the stones, this is he who, hearing the word, straight away takes it with joy;","021":"But having no root in himself, he goes on for a time; and when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, he quickly becomes full of doubts.","022":"And that which was dropped among the thorns, this is he who has the word; and the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit.","023":"And the seed which was put in good earth, this is he who gives ear to the word, and gets the sense of it; who gives fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.","024":"And he gave them another story, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field:","025":"But while men were sleeping, one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain, and went away.","026":"But when the green stem came up and gave fruit, the evil plants were seen at the same time.","027":"And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not put good seed in your field? how then has it evil plants?","028":"And he said, Someone has done this in hate. And the servants say to him, Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up?","029":"But he says, No, for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants, you may be rooting up the grain with them.","030":"Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain; and then I will say to the workers, Take up first the evil plants, and put them together for burning: but put the grain into my store-house.","031":"He put another story before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field:","032":"Which is smaller than all seeds; but when it has come up it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting-places in its branches.","033":"Another story he gave to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and put in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.","034":"All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories; and without a story he said nothing to them:","035":"That it might come true which was said by the prophet, Opening my mouth, I will give out stories; I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time.","036":"Then he went away from the people, and went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field.","037":"And he made answer and said, He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man;","038":"And the field is the world; and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom; and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One;","039":"And he who put them in the earth is Satan; and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world; and those who get it in are the angels.","040":"As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire, so will it be in the end of the world.","041":"The Son of man will send out his angels, and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error, and all those who do wrong,","042":"And will put them into the fire; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.","043":"Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

she has done a kind act to me.","011":"For the poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.","012":"For in putting this perfume on my body, she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place.","013":"Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news goes out in all the world, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her.","014":"Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,","015":"What will you give me, if I give him up to you? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver.","016":"And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands.","017":"Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal?","018":"And he said to them, Go into the town to such a man, and say to him, The Master says, My time is near: I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.","019":"And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them; and they made ready the Passover.","020":"Now when evening was come, he was seated at table with the twelve disciples;","021":"And while they were taking food, he said, Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me.","022":"And they were very said, and said to him, one by one, Is it I, Lord?","023":"And he made answer and said, He who puts his hand into the plate with me, the same will be false to me.","024":"The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up; it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world.","025":"And Judas, who was false to him, made answer and said, Is it I, Master? He says to him, Yes.","026":"And when they were taking food, Jesus took bread and, after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said, Take it; this is my body.","027":"And he took a cup and, having given praise, he gave it to them, saying,","028":"Take of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the testament, which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins.","029":"But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I take it new with you in my Father\u0027s kingdom.","030":"And after a song of praise to God, they went out to the Mountain of Olives.","031":"Then said Jesus to them, All of you will be turned away from me this night: for it is said in the Writings, I will put to death the keeper of the sheep, and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight.","032":"But after I am come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.","033":"But Peter made answer and said to him, Though all may be turned away from you, I will never be turned away.","034":"Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the hour of the cock\u0027s cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.","035":"Peter says to him, Even if I am put to death with you, I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples.","036":"Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Be seated here, while I go over there for prayer.","037":"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled.","038":"Then says he to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: keep watch with me here.","039":"And he went forward a little, and falling down on his face in prayer, he said, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup go from me; but let not my pleasure, but yours be done.","040":"And he comes to the disciples, and sees that they are sleeping, and says to Peter, What, were you not able to keep watch with me one hour?","041":"Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test: the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.","042":"Again, a second time he went away, and said in prayer, O my Father, if this may not go from me without my taking it, let your pleasure be done.","043":"And he came again and saw them sleeping, for their eyes were tired.","044":"And he went away from them again, and a third time said the same prayer.","045":"Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.","046":"Up, let us be going: see, he who gives me up is near.","047":"And while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a band armed with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and those in authority over the people.","048":"Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him.","049":"And straight away he came to Jesus and said, Master! and gave him a kiss.","050":"And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that for which you have come. Then they came and put hands on Jesus, and took him.","051":"And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand, and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.","052":"Then says Jesus to him, Put up your sword again into its place: for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword.","053":"Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels?","054":"But how then would the Writings come true, which say that so it has to be?","055":"In that hour Jesus said to the people, Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not.","056":"But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight.","057":"And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together.","058":"But Peter went after him at a distance, to the house of the high priest, and went in and took his seat with the servants, to see the end.","059":"Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;","060":"And they were not able to get it, though a number of false witnesses came.","061":"But later there came two who said, This man said, I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction, and to put it up again in three days.","062":"And the high priest got up and said to him, Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you?","063":"But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him, I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will say to us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.","064":"Jesus says to him, You say so: but I say to you, From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.","065":"Then the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, He has said evil against God: what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears:","066":"What is your opinion? They made answer and said, It is right for him to be put to death.","067":"Then they put shame on him, and were cruel to him: and some gave him blows, saying,","068":"Be a prophet, O Christ, and say who gave you a blow!","069":"Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house: and a servant-girl came to him, saying, You were with Jesus the Galilaean.","070":"But he said before them all that it was false, saying, I have no knowledge of what you say.","071":"And when he had gone out into the doorway, another saw him and says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.","072":"And again he said with an oath, I have no knowledge of the man.","073":"And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; because your talk is witness against you.","074":"Then with curses and oaths he said, I have no knowledge of the man. And straight away there came the cry of a cock.","075":"And the word of Jesus came back to Peter, when he said, Before the hour of the cock\u0027s cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And he went out, weeping bitterly."},"027":{"001":"Now when it was morning, all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting Jesus to death.","002":"And they put cords on him and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate, the ruler.","003":"Then Judas, who was false to him, seeing that he was to be put to death, in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority,","004":"Saying, I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man. But they said, What is that to us? it is your business.","005":"And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out, and put himself to death by hanging.","006":"And the chief priests took the silver and said, It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood.","007":"And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter\u0027s field, as a place for the dead of other countries.","008":"For this cause that field was named, The field of blood, to this day.","009":"Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty bits of silver, the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel;","010":"And they gave them for the potter\u0027s field, as I had word from the Lord.","011":"And Jesus was before the ruler, who put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so.","012":"But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.","013":"Then says Pilate to him, Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?","014":"And he gave him no answer, not even a word: so that the ruler was greatly surprised.","015":"Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner, at their selection.","016":"And they had then an important prisoner, whose name was Barabbas.","017":"So when they came together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you have? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is named Christ?","018":"For he saw that for envy they had given him up.","019":"And while he was on the judge\u0027s seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that upright man, for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.","020":"Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.","021":"But the ruler made answer and said to them, Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free? And they said, Barabbas.","022":"Pilate says to them, What, then, am I to do with Jesus, who is named Christ? They all say, Let him be put to death on the cross.","023":"And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries, saying, To the cross with him!","024":"So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing, but that trouble was working up, he took water and, washing his hands before the people, said, The blood of this upright man is not on my hands: you are responsible.","025":"And all the people made answer and said, Let his blood be on us, and on our children.","026":"Then he let Barabbas go free: but after having Jesus whipped, he gave him up to be put to death on the cross.","027":"Then the ruler\u0027s armed men took Jesus into the open square, and got all their band together.","028":"And they took off his clothing, and put on him a red robe.","029":"And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a rod in his right hand, and they went down on their knees before him, and made sport of him, saying, Long life to the King of the Jews.","030":"And they put shame on him, and gave him blows on the head with the rod.","031":"And when they had made sport of him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothing on him, and took him away to put him on the cross.","032":"And while they were coming out, they saw a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they made him go with them, so that he might take up his cross.","033":"And when they came to the place named Golgotha, that is to say, Dead Man\u0027s Head,","034":"They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink: and after tasting it, he took no more.","035":"And when they had put him on the cross, they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.","036":"And they were seated there watching him.","037":"And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","038":"Then two thieves were put on crosses with him, one on the right and one on the left.","039":"And those who went by said bitter words to him, shaking their heads and saying,","040":"You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days, get yourself free: if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.","041":"In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said,","042":"A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will have faith in him.","043":"He put his faith in God; let God be his saviour now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.","044":"And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him.","045":"Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.","046":"And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?","047":"And some of those who were near by, hearing it, said, This man is crying to Elijah.","048":"And straight away one of them went quickly, and took a sponge, and made it full of bitter wine, and put it on a rod and gave him drink.","049":"And the rest said, Let him be; let us see if Elijah will come to his help.","050":"And Jesus gave another loud cry, and gave up his spirit.","051":"And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end; and there was an earth-shock; and the rocks were broken;","052":"And the resting-places of the dead came open; and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life;","053":"And coming out of their resting-places, after he had come again from the dead, they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people.","054":"Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done, were in great fear and said, Truly this was a son of God.","055":"And a number of women were there, watching from a distance, who had come with Jesus from Galilee, waiting on his needs.","056":"Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.","057":"And in the evening, there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea, Joseph by name, who was a disciple of Jesus:","058":"This man went in to Pilate, and made a request for the body of Jesus.

Come, see the Lord\u0027s resting-place.","007":"And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you.","008":"And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news.","009":"And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship.","010":"Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me.","011":"Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place.","012":"And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying,","013":"Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping.","014":"And if this comes to the ruler\u0027s ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible.","015":"So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time.","016":"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go.","017":"And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt.","018":"And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.","019":"Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:","020":"Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world."}}
