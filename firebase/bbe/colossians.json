{"001":{"001":"Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the purpose of God, and Timothy our brother,","002":"To the saints and true brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.","003":"We give praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, making prayer for you at all times,","004":"After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have for all the saints,","005":"Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven; knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news,","006":"Which has come to you; and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase, as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God;","007":"As it was given to you by Epaphras, our well-loved helper, who is a true servant of Christ for us,","008":"And who, himself, made clear to us your love in the Spirit.","009":"For this reason, we, from the day when we had word of it, keep on in prayer for you, that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose, with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit,","010":"Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord, giving fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;","011":"Full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory, so that you may undergo all troubles with joy;","012":"Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light;","013":"Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love;","014":"In whom we have our salvation, the forgiveness of sins:","015":"Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things;","016":"For by him all things were made, in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen, authorities, lords, rulers, and powers; all things were made by him and for him;","017":"He is before all things, and in him all things have being.","018":"And he is the head of the body, the church: the starting point of all things, the first to come again from the dead; so that in all things he might have the chief place.","019":"For God in full measure was pleased to be in him;","020":"Through him uniting all things with himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, I say, uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven.","021":"And you, who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works, he has now made one","022":"In the body of his flesh through death, so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him:","023":"If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith, not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you, and which was given to every living being under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.","024":"Now I have joy in my pain because of you, and in my flesh I undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of Christ complete, for the salvation of his body, the church;","025":"Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you, to give effect to the word of God,","026":"The secret which has been kept from all times and generations, but has now been made clear to his saints,","027":"To whom God was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:","028":"Whom we are preaching;

but the body is Christ\u0027s.","018":"Let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels; having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen, being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind,","019":"And not joined to the Head, from whom all the body, being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands, has its growth with the increase of God.","020":"If you were made free, by your death with Christ, from the rules of the world, why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders","021":"Which say there may be no touching, tasting, or taking in your hands,","022":"(Rules which are all to come to an end with their use) after the orders and teaching of men?","023":"These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself, and being cruel to the body, not honouring it by giving it its natural use."},"003":{"001":"If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.","002":"Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth.","003":"For your life on earth is done, and you have a secret life with Christ in God.","004":"At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory.","005":"Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods;","006":"Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders;","007":"Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things.","008":"But now it is right for you to put away all these things;
