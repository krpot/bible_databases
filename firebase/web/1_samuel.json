{"001":{"001":"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:","002":"and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","003":"This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Hosts in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.","004":"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:","005":"but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.","006":"Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.","007":"[as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.","008":"Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why don\u0027t you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten sons?","009":"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.","010":"She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.","011":"She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.","012":"It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked her mouth.","013":"Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.","014":"Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.","015":"Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.","016":"Don\u0027t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.","017":"Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.","018":"She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn\u0027t sad any more.","019":"They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.","020":"It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.","021":"The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.","022":"But Hannah didn\u0027t go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.","023":"Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.","024":"When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.","025":"They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.","026":"She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.","027":"For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:","028":"therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. He worshiped Yahweh there."},"002":{"001":"Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh; My horn is exalted in Yahweh; My mouth is enlarged over my enemies; Because I rejoice in your salvation.","002":"There is none holy as Yahweh; For there is none besides you, Neither is there any rock like our God.","003":"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Don\u0027t let arrogance come out of your mouth; For Yahweh is a God of knowledge, By him actions are weighed.","004":"The bows of the mighty men are broken; Those who stumbled are girded with strength.","005":"Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread; Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]: Yes, the barren has borne seven; She who has many children languishes.","006":"Yahweh kills, and makes alive: He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.","007":"Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich: He brings low, he also lifts up.","008":"He raises up the poor out of the dust, He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, Inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh\u0027s, He has set the world on them.","009":"He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.","010":"Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in the sky: Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth; He will give strength to his king, Exalt the horn of his anointed.","011":"Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child did minister to Yahweh before Eli the priest.","012":"Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn\u0027t know Yahweh.","013":"The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest\u0027s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;","014":"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.","015":"Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest\u0027s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.","016":"If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.","017":"The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.","018":"But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.","019":"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","020":"Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh. They went to their own home.","021":"Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.","022":"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.","023":"He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.","024":"No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh\u0027s people to disobey.","025":"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn\u0027t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to kill them.","026":"The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.","027":"There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh\u0027s house?","028":"and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?","029":"Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?","030":"Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.","031":"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father\u0027s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.","032":"You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.","033":"The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.","034":"This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.","035":"I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.","036":"It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests\u0027 offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."},"003":{"001":"The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli.

He answered, I didn\u0027t call, my son; lie down again.","007":"Now Samuel didn\u0027t yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.","008":"Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.","009":"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","010":"Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.","011":"Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.","012":"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.","013":"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse on themselves, and he didn\u0027t restrain them.","014":"Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli\u0027s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.","015":"Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.","016":"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. He said, Here am I.","017":"He said, \\\"What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you?

Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.","002":"The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.","003":"When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.","004":"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Hosts, who sits [above] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","005":"When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.","006":"When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?

So they went to the city where the man of God was.","011":"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?","012":"They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:","013":"as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited. Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.","014":"They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.","015":"Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,","016":"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.","017":"When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.","018":"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, Please, where the seer\u0027s house is.","019":"Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.","020":"As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don\u0027t set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father\u0027s house?","021":"Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?","022":"Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.","023":"Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.","024":"The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.","025":"When they were come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.","026":"They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.","027":"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God."},"010":{"001":"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Isn\u0027t it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?","002":"When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel\u0027s tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found; and, behold, your father has left off caring for the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?","003":"Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:","004":"and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.","005":"After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:","006":"and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.","007":"Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.","008":"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shall you wait, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.","009":"It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.","010":"When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.","011":"It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?","012":"One of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?","013":"When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.","014":"Saul\u0027s uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you? He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.","015":"Saul\u0027s uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.","016":"Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn\u0027t tell him.","017":"Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;","018":"and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:","019":"but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, [No], but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.","020":"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.","021":"He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.","022":"Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man to come here? Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.","023":"They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.","024":"Samuel said to all the people, \\\"You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?\\\" All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.","025":"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.","026":"Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.","027":"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?

They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.","006":"The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.","007":"He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn\u0027t come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.","008":"He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.","009":"They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.","010":"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.","011":"It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.","012":"The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.","013":"Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.","014":"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.","015":"All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."},"012":{"001":"Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.","002":"Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.","003":"Here I am: witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.","004":"They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man\u0027s hand.","005":"He said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.

Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;","018":"and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, \u0027Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.\u0027","019":"Why then didn\u0027t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?\\\"","020":"Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.","021":"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.","022":"Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.","023":"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.","024":"Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.","025":"Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.","026":"Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.","027":"As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it tore.","028":"Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.","029":"Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.","030":"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, Please, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.","031":"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.","032":"Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.","033":"Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.","034":"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.","035":"Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh repented that he had made Saul king over Israel."},"016":{"001":"Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go: I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.","002":"Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh.","003":"Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.","004":"Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Come you peaceably?","005":"He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.","006":"It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, Surely Yahweh\u0027s anointed is before him.","007":"But Yahweh said to Samuel, \\\"Don\u0027t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.\\\"","008":"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.","009":"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.","010":"Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.","011":"Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? He said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he come here.","012":"He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.","013":"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.","014":"Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.","015":"Saul\u0027s servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.","016":"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp: and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.","017":"Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.","018":"Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.","019":"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.","020":"Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.","021":"David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.","022":"Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.","023":"It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."},"017":{"001":"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.","002":"Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.","003":"The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.","004":"There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.","005":"He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.","006":"He had brass shin-armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.","007":"The staff of his spear was like a weaver\u0027s beam; and his spear\u0027s head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.","008":"He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array?
