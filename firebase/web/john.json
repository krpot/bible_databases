Don\u0027t be afraid.\\\"","021":"They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.","022":"On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn\u0027t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.","023":"However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.","024":"When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn\u0027t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.","025":"When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, \\\"Rabbi, when did you come here?\\\"","026":"Jesus answered them, \\\"Most assuredly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.","027":"Don\u0027t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.\\\"","028":"They said therefore to him, \\\"What must we do, that we may work the works of God?\\\"","029":"Jesus answered them, \\\"This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.\\\"","030":"They said therefore to him, \\\"What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?","031":"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.

He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.","036":"But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don\u0027t believe.","037":"All those who the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.","038":"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.","039":"This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.","040":"This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\\\"","041":"The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, \\\"I am the bread which came down out of heaven.\\\"","042":"They said, \\\"Isn\u0027t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?

He has seen the Father.","047":"Most assuredly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.","048":"I am the bread of life.","049":"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.","050":"This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.","051":"I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\\\"","052":"The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, \\\"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\\\"","053":"Jesus therefore said to them, \\\"Most assuredly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don\u0027t have life in yourselves.","054":"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.","055":"For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.","056":"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.","057":"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.","058":"This is the bread which came down out of heaven-- not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.\\\"","059":"These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.","060":"Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, \\\"This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?\\\"","061":"But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, \\\"Does this cause you to stumble?","062":"Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?","063":"It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.","064":"But there are some of you who don\u0027t believe.\\\" For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn\u0027t believe, and who it was who would betray him.","065":"He said, \\\"For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.\\\"","066":"At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.","067":"Jesus said therefore to the twelve, \\\"You don\u0027t also want to go away, do you?\\\"","068":"Simon Peter answered him, \\\"Lord, to whom would we go?

Why do you seek to kill me?\\\"","020":"The multitude answered, \\\"You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?\\\"","021":"Jesus answered them, \\\"I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.","022":"Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.","023":"If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?","024":"Don\u0027t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\\\"","025":"Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, \\\"Isn\u0027t this he whom they seek to kill?","026":"Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him.
