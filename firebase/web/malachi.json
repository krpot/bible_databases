With this, will he accept any of you?\\\" says Yahweh of Hosts.","010":"\\\"Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,\\\" says Yahweh of hosts, \\\"neither will I accept an offering at your hand.","011":"For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,\\\" says Yahweh of Hosts.","012":"\\\"But you profane it, in that you say, \u0027Yahweh\u0027s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.\u0027","013":"You say also, \u0027Behold, what a weariness it is!\u0027 and you have sniffed at it,\\\" says Yahweh of Hosts; \\\"and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?\\\" says Yahweh.","014":"\\\"But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,\\\" says Yahweh of hosts, \\\"and my name is awesome among the nations.\\\""},"002":{"001":"\\\"Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.","002":"If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,\\\" says Yahweh of Hosts, \\\"then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.","003":"Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.","004":"You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,\\\" says Yahweh of Hosts.","005":"\\\"My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him who he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.","006":"The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips.
