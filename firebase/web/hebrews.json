two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.","019":"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;","020":"where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."},"007":{"001":"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","002":"to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;","003":"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.","004":"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.","005":"They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u0027s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that

promises.","007":"But without any dispute the less is blessed by the better.","008":"Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.","009":"So

Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?","012":"For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.","013":"For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.","014":"For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.","015":"This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,","016":"who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:","017":"for it is testified, \\\"You are a priest forever, According to the order of Melchizedek.\\\"","018":"For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness","019":"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.","020":"Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath","021":"(for

death.","024":"But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.","025":"Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.","026":"For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;","027":"who doesn\u0027t need, like those high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people.

Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.","004":"For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;","005":"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, \\\"See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.\\\"","006":"But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.","007":"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.","008":"For finding fault with them, he said, \\\"Behold, the days come,\\\" says the Lord, \\\"That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;","009":"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; For they didn\u0027t continue in my covenant, And I disregarded them,\\\" says the Lord.","010":"\\\"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.

Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.","020":"By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.","021":"By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.","022":"By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.","023":"By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king\u0027s commandment.","024":"By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u0027s daughter,","025":"choosing rather to share ill treatment with God\u0027s people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;","026":"accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.","027":"By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.","028":"By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.","029":"By faith, they passed through the Red sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.","030":"By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.","031":"By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn\u0027t perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.","032":"What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;","033":"who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,","034":"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and turned to flight armies of aliens.","035":"Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.","036":"Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.","037":"They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated","038":"(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.","039":"These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn\u0027t receive the promise,","040":"God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect."},"012":{"001":"Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,","002":"looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.","003":"For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don\u0027t grow weary, fainting in your souls.","004":"You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;","005":"and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, \\\"My son, don\u0027t take lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when you are reproved by him;","006":"For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, And scourges every son whom he receives.\\\"","007":"It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn\u0027t discipline?","008":"But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.","009":"Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?","010":"For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.","011":"All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.","012":"Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,","013":"and make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.","014":"Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,","015":"looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled;","016":"lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, as Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.","017":"For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.","018":"For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, tempest,","019":"the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,","020":"for they could not stand that which was commanded, \\\"If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned{TR adds \\\"or shot with an arrow\\\" [see Exodus 19:12-13]};\\\"","021":"and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, \\\"I am terrified and trembling.\\\"","022":"But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,","023":"to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,","024":"to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.","025":"See that you don\u0027t refuse him who speaks.

Amen.","022":"But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.","023":"Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.","024":"Greet all of your leaders and all the saints.
