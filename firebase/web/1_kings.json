Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.","031":"His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your life.","032":"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live. He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.","033":"Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben Hadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Ben Hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.","034":"[Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.","035":"A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The man refused to strike him.","036":"Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you. As soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.","037":"Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me. The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.","038":"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.","039":"As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.","040":"As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.","041":"He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.","042":"He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.","043":"The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria."},"021":{"001":"It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.","002":"Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.","003":"Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.","004":"Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.","005":"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?","006":"He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.","007":"Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.","008":"So she wrote letters in Ahab\u0027s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, [and] who lived with Naboth.","009":"She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:","010":"and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, You did curse God and the king. Then carry him out, and stone him to death.","011":"The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.","012":"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.","013":"The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.","014":"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.","015":"It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.","016":"It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.","017":"The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","018":"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to take possession of it.","019":"You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.","020":"Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy? He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.","021":"Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel:","022":"and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.","023":"Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.","024":"Him who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.","025":"(But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.","026":"He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.)","027":"It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.","028":"The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","029":"See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son\u0027s days will I bring the evil on his house."},"022":{"001":"They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.","002":"It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.","003":"The king of Israel said to his servants, \\\"You know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and don\u0027t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?\\\"","004":"He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.","005":"Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.","006":"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.","007":"But Jehoshaphat said, Isn\u0027t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?","008":"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said, \\\"Don\u0027t let the king say so.\\\"","009":"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.","010":"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","011":"Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians, until they be consumed.","012":"All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.","013":"The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth: please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak you good.","014":"Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that will I speak.","015":"When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? He answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.","016":"The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?","017":"He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.","018":"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn\u0027t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?","019":"[Micaiah] said, Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.","020":"Yahweh said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? One said on this manner; and another said on that manner.","021":"There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, I will entice him.","022":"Yahweh said to him, \u0027How?\u0027 He said, \u0027I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.\u0027 He said, \u0027You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.\u0027","023":"Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.","024":"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?","025":"Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.","026":"The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king\u0027s son;","027":"and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.","028":"Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.
