{"001":{"001":"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.","002":"Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;","003":"Knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.","004":"And let patience have `its\u0027 perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.","005":"But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.","006":"But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.","007":"For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;","008":"a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.","009":"But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:","010":"and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.","011":"For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass: and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.","012":"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which `the Lord\u0027 promised to them that love him.","013":"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:","014":"but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.","015":"Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.","016":"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.","017":"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.","018":"Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.","019":"Ye know `this\u0027, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:","020":"for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.","021":"Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.","022":"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.","023":"For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:","024":"for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.","025":"But he that looketh into the perfect law, the `law\u0027 of liberty, and `so\u0027 continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.","026":"If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man\u0027s religion is vain.","027":"Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, `and\u0027 to keep oneself unspotted from the world."},"002":{"001":"My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, `the Lord\u0027 of glory, with respect of persons.","002":"For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;","003":"and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;","004":"Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?","005":"Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world `to be\u0027 rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?","006":"But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?","007":"Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?","008":"Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:","009":"but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.","010":"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one `point\u0027, he is become guilty of all.","011":"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.","012":"So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.","013":"For judgment `is\u0027 without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.","014":"What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?","015":"If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,","016":"and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?","017":"Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.","018":"Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from `thy\u0027 works, and I by my works will show thee `my\u0027 faith.","019":"Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.","020":"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?","021":"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?","022":"Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;","023":"and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.","024":"Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.","025":"And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?","026":"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead."},"003":{"001":"Be not many `of you\u0027 teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.","002":"For in many things we all stumble.

Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!","006":"And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.","007":"For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.","008":"But the tongue can no man tame; `it is\u0027 a restless evil, `it is\u0027 full of deadly poison.","009":"Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:","010":"out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing.

Neither `can\u0027 salt water yield sweet.","013":"Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.","014":"But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.","015":"This wisdom is not `a wisdom\u0027 that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.","016":"For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.","017":"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.","018":"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace."},"004":{"001":"Whence `come\u0027 wars and whence `come\u0027 fightings among you? `come they\u0027 not hence, `even\u0027 of your pleasures that war in your members?","002":"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.","003":"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend `it\u0027 in your pleasures.","004":"Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.","005":"Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain?
