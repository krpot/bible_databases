He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.","017":"Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.","018":"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.","019":"What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; `and it was\u0027 ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.","020":"Now a mediator is not `a mediator\u0027 of one; but God is one.","021":"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.","022":"But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.","023":"But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.","024":"So that the law is become our tutor `to bring us\u0027 unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.","025":"But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.","026":"For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.","027":"For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.","028":"There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one `man\u0027 in Christ Jesus.","029":"And if ye are Christ\u0027s, then are ye Abraham\u0027s seed, heirs according to promise."},"004":{"001":"But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;","002":"but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.","003":"So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:","004":"but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,","005":"that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.","006":"And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.","007":"So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.","008":"Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:","009":"but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?","010":"Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.","011":"I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.","012":"I beseech you, brethren, become as I `am\u0027, for I also `am become\u0027 as ye `are\u0027.
