She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.","014":"When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.","015":"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.","016":"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.","017":"Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.","018":"Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and `that\u0027 he had said these things unto her.","019":"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first `day\u0027 of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace `be\u0027 unto you.","020":"And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.","021":"Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace `be\u0027 unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.","022":"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:","023":"whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever `sins\u0027 ye retain, they are retained.","024":"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","025":"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord.

They answered him, No.","006":"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.","007":"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.","008":"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net `full\u0027 of fishes.","009":"So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.","010":"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.","011":"Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.","012":"Jesus saith unto them, Come `and\u0027 break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.","013":"Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.","014":"This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.","015":"So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, `son\u0027 of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.","016":"He saith to him again a second time, Simon, `son\u0027 of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.","017":"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, `son\u0027 of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.","018":"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.","019":"Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.","020":"Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?","021":"Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?","022":"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what `is that\u0027 to thee? Follow thou me.","023":"This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what `is that\u0027 to thee?","024":"This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.","025":"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written."}}
