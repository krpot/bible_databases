{"001":{"001":"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,","002":"and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:","003":"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","004":"I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,","005":"hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;","006":"that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.","007":"For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.","008":"Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,","009":"yet for love\u0027s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:","010":"I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,","011":"who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:","012":"whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:","013":"whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:","014":"but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.","015":"For perhaps he was therefore parted `from thee\u0027 for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;","016":"no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.","017":"If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.","018":"But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth `thee\u0027 aught, put that to mine account;","019":"I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.","020":"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.","021":"Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.","022":"But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.","023":"Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;","024":"`and so do\u0027 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.","025":"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."}}
