that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?","010":"He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)","011":"And he gave some

after the lusts of deceit;","023":"and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,","024":"and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of

is.","018":"And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;","019":"speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;","020":"giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;","021":"subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.","022":"Wives, `be in subjection\u0027 unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.","023":"For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, `being\u0027
