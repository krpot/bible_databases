they shall be cities of refuge.","015":"For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.","016":"But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","017":"And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","018":"Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","019":"The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.","020":"And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,","021":"or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.","022":"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,","023":"or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;","024":"then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;","025":"and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.","026":"But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,","027":"and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,","028":"because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.","029":"And these things shall be for a statute `and\u0027 ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.","030":"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.","031":"Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.","032":"And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.","033":"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.","034":"And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel."},"036":{"001":"And the heads of the fathers\u0027 `houses\u0027 of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers\u0027 `houses\u0027 of the children of Israel:","002":"and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.","003":"And if they be married to any of the sons of the `other\u0027 tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.","004":"And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.","005":"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.","006":"This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best;
