for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house `continued\u0027 upward; and so one went up `from\u0027 the lowest `chamber\u0027 to the highest by the middle `chamber\u0027.","008":"I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.","009":"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.","010":"And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.","011":"And the doors of the side-chambers were toward `the place\u0027 that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.","012":"And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.","013":"So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;","014":"also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.","015":"And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;","016":"the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and `from\u0027 the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),","017":"to `the space\u0027 above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.","018":"And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;","019":"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. `thus was it\u0027 made through all the house round about:","020":"from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.","021":"As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance `thereof\u0027 was as the appearance `of the temple\u0027.","022":"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.","023":"And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.","024":"And the doors had two leaves `apiece\u0027, two turning leaves: two `leaves\u0027 for the one door, and two leaves for the other.","025":"And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.","026":"And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds."},"042":{"001":"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.","002":"Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.","003":"Over against the twenty `cubits\u0027 which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.","004":"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits\u0027 breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.","005":"Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.","006":"For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore `the uppermost\u0027 was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.","007":"And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.","008":"For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.","009":"And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.","010":"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.","011":"And the way before them was like the appearance of `the way of\u0027 the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.","012":"And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.","013":"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.","014":"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.","015":"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.","016":"He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.","017":"He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.","018":"He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.","019":"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.","020":"He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common."},"043":{"001":"Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.","002":"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.","003":"And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.","004":"And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.","005":"And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.","006":"And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.","007":"And he said unto me, Son of man, `this is\u0027 the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever.

Behold, this is the law of the house.","013":"And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.","014":"And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.","015":"And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.","016":"And the altar hearth shall be twelve `cubits\u0027 long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.","017":"And the ledge shall be fourteen `cubits\u0027 long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.","018":"And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.","019":"Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.","020":"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.","021":"Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.","022":"And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.","023":"When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.","024":"And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","025":"Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.","026":"Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.","027":"And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings;

he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.","004":"Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.","005":"And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.","006":"And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,","007":"in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, `to add\u0027 unto all your abominations.","008":"And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things;
