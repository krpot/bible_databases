And `David\u0027 mourned for his son every day.","038":"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.","039":"And `the soul of\u0027 king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."},"014":{"001":"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king\u0027s heart was toward Absalom.","002":"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:","003":"and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.","004":"And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.","005":"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.","006":"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.","007":"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.","008":"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.","009":"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father\u0027s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.","010":"And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.","011":"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.","012":"Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.","013":"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.","014":"For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.","015":"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.","016":"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.","017":"Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.","018":"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.","019":"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;","020":"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.","021":"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.","022":"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.","023":"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","024":"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king\u0027s face.","025":"Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.","026":"And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year\u0027s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king\u0027s weight.","027":"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.","028":"And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king\u0027s face.","029":"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.","030":"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab\u0027s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom\u0027s servants set the field on fire.","031":"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?","032":"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king\u0027s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.","033":"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."},"015":{"001":"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.","002":"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.","003":"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.","004":"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!","005":"And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.","006":"And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.","007":"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.","008":"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.","009":"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.","010":"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.","011":"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.","012":"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David\u0027s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.","013":"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.","014":"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.","015":"And the king\u0027s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.","016":"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.","017":"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.","018":"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.","019":"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; `return\u0027 to thine own place.","020":"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.","021":"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.","022":"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.
