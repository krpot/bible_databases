being destitute, afflicted, tormented;","038":"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.","039":"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:","040":"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."},"012":{"001":"Wherefore, seeing we also are encompassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,","002":"Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.","003":"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.","004":"Ye have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.","005":"And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh to you as to children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked by him:","006":"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.","007":"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?","008":"But if ye are without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.","009":"Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?","010":"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.","011":"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who are exercised by it.","012":"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;","013":"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.","014":"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:","015":"Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and by it many be defiled;","016":"Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birth-right.","017":"For ye know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.","018":"For ye are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and to darkness, and tempest,","019":"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words;
