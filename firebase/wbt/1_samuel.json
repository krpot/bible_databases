{"001":{"001":"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:","002":"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","003":"And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.","004":"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:","005":"But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.","006":"And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.","007":"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.","008":"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?","009":"So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.","010":"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.","011":"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.","012":"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.","013":"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.","014":"And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.","015":"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.","016":"Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.","017":"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.","018":"And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.","019":"And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.","020":"Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.","021":"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.","022":"But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.","023":"And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.","024":"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.","025":"And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.","026":"And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.","027":"For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:","028":"Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.

And they went to their own home.","021":"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters.

And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.","006":"And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.","007":"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.","008":"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.","009":"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","010":"And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.","011":"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.","012":"In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.","013":"For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.","014":"And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli\u0027s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.","015":"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.","016":"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.","017":"And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.","018":"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.","019":"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.","020":"And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.","021":"And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD."},"004":{"001":"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

But he answered him not that day.","038":"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.","039":"For as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.","040":"Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.","041":"Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.","042":"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.","043":"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, lo, I must die.","044":"And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.","045":"And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.","046":"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.","047":"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed them.","048":"And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.","049":"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:","050":"And the name of Saul\u0027s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul\u0027s uncle.","051":"And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.","052":"And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself."},"015":{"001":"Samuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of the LORD.","002":"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.","003":"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.","004":"And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.","005":"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.","006":"And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.","007":"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.","008":"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.","009":"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.","010":"Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,","011":"I repent that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.","012":"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.","013":"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.","014":"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?","015":"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.","016":"Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.","017":"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thy own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?","018":"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.","019":"Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?","020":"And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.","021":"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.","022":"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.","023":"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.","024":"And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.","025":"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.","026":"And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.","027":"And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.","028":"And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.","029":"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.","030":"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.","031":"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.","032":"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.","033":"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.","034":"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.","035":"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel."},"016":{"001":"And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.","002":"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.","003":"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me him whom I name to thee.","004":"And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?","005":"And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.","006":"And it came to pass when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD\u0027S anointed is before him.","007":"But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the hight of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.","008":"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.","009":"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.","010":"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.","011":"And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he hath come hither.","012":"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and also of a beautiful countenance, and a good appearance. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.","013":"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.","014":"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.","015":"And Saul\u0027s servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.","016":"Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek a man who is a skillful player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he will play with his hand, and thou wilt be well.","017":"And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.","018":"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.","019":"Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.","020":"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.","021":"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.","022":"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.","023":"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."},"017":{"001":"Now the Philistines collected their armies to battle, and were assembled at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.","002":"And Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and encamped by the valley of Elah, and they set the battle in array against the Philistines.","003":"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.","004":"And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose hight was six cubits and a span.","005":"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.","006":"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.","007":"And the staff of his spear was like a weaver\u0027s beam; and his spear\u0027s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.","008":"And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set your battle in array?

Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"},"020":{"001":"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?","002":"And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing, either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.","003":"And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved: But truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.","004":"Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.","005":"And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new-moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.","006":"If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me, that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.","007":"If he shall say thus, It is well; thy servant will have peace: but if he shall be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.","008":"Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?","009":"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?","010":"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father shall answer thee roughly?","011":"And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.","012":"And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, or the third day, and behold, if there be good towards David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;","013":"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.","014":"And thou shalt, not only while yet I live, show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:","015":"But also thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.","016":"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David\u0027s enemies.","017":"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.","018":"Then Jonathan said to David, To-morrow is the new-moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.","019":"And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.","020":"And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.","021":"And behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.","022":"But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.","023":"And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.","024":"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new-moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.","025":"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul\u0027s side, and David\u0027s place was empty.","026":"Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.","027":"And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David\u0027s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?","028":"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:","029":"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother he hath commanded me to be there: and now if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king\u0027s table.","030":"Then Saul\u0027s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mother\u0027s nakedness?","031":"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.","032":"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?","033":"And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.","034":"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.","035":"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.","036":"And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow, beyond him.","037":"And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?","038":"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan\u0027s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.","039":"But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.","040":"And Jonathan gave his arms to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.","041":"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place towards the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."}}
