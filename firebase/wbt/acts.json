And they said, Into John\u0027s baptism.","004":"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, That they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.","005":"When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.","006":"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke in languages, and prophesied.","007":"And all the men were about twelve.","008":"And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.","009":"But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.","010":"And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.","011":"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:","012":"So that from his body were brought to the sick, handkerchiefs, or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.","013":"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them who had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.","014":"And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jew, and chief of the priests, who did so.","015":"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?","016":"And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","017":"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus: and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.","018":"And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.","019":"Many also of them who used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.","020":"So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.","021":"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia, and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.","022":"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.","023":"And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.","024":"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the artificers;","025":"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth:","026":"Moreover, ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away many people, saying, that they are no gods which are made with hands.","027":"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia, and the world worshipeth.","028":"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","029":"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul\u0027s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater.","030":"And when Paul would have entered in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.","031":"And certain of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theater.","032":"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not why they had come together.","033":"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.","034":"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","035":"And when the town-clerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?","036":"Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.","037":"For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.","038":"Wherefore, if Demetrius and the artificers who are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.","039":"But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."}}
