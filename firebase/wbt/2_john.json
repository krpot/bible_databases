This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.","007":"For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist.","008":"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.","009":"Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.","010":"If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him happiness:","011":"For he that wisheth him happiness, is partaker of his evil deeds.","012":"Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.","013":"The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen."}}
