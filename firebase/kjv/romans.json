Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.","019":"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.","020":"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.","021":"But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."},"011":{"001":"I say then, Hath God cast away his people?

God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.","012":"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?","013":"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:","014":"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.","015":"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?","016":"For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.","017":"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;","018":"Boast not against the branches.
